# Light-Transcoder

This project contains an HTTP-API to allow real-time transcode of media files into DASH / HLS streams.  
This API will provide you a streamable link, based on compatibility map provided by you app.  
The API is similar to the "StreamingBrain" feature from Plex, Emby or Jellyfin.

## Try it

- `npm i` to install dependencies.
- `npm start` to launch the server.
- Go to `http://localhost:8585/`. Source code available here => https://github.com/Maxou44/light-transcoder-player
- Change the link if needed.
- Press enter.
- Have fun! üòâ
